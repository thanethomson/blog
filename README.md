## Overview
This repo contains the [Statik](https://github.com/thanethomson/statik)
source code for [my personal blog](https://thanethomson.com). This is
to serve as one possible example of how **Statik** can be used to
build a blog.

## Building
In order to build this blog, first make sure you have **Statik**
`v0.16.1` installed. A sample project configuration file is
provided in `config-dev.yml` (the version I use during development,
which disabled analytics and Disqus comments). Then:

```bash
> statik -p config-dev.yml
```
