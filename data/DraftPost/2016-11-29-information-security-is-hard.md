The further I head down the rabbit hole that is information security,
the more overwhelmed I feel. It's hard not to feel disheartened when
you confront the list of [known vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Attacks_against_TLS.2FSSL)
and you realise that you've got a mountain to climb in terms of your
understanding, all the way from understanding the networking and
security protocols that make up the internet, like
[IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol),
[TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) and
[TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security),
low-level software attacks like
[buffer overflow attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow),
all the way up to higher-level attacks like
[XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) and
[SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection).
There are literally so many potential *attack surfaces*, as they're
called in the industry, in modern software that it'll make your
head spin. This isn't even taking into account the understanding of
cryptographic algorithms and all their mathematical and computational
complexity, and the battle to find algorithms that are
[resistant to quantum computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography).
