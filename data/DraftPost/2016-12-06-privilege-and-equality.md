  As a species, we still seem to struggle with grasping the complex
  relationship between practical privilege and idealistic notions
  of equality. This is especially true in South Africa. How can we
  reconcile these two, potentially conflicting, realities?

From a social perspective, South Africa is a country of
[extremes](http://www.businessinsider.com/drone-photos-show-inequality-in-south-africa-2016-6).
Just take a look at the Wikipedia article on
[Inequality in post-apartheid South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_in_post-apartheid_South_Africa)
to see the statistics. The trouble with inequality is that it tends
to breed even more inequality. It's relatively easy to see how
solutions could exist in wealthy countries where the majority of
citizens are privileged from birth, but how do we address this issue
in a country like South Africa, where a
[tiny minority hold the majority of the country's wealth](http://hsf.org.za/resource-centre/hsf-briefs/the-distribution-of-income-and-the-distribution-of-wealth-in-south-africa-part-i-the-facts)?

## Equality
The notion of **equality** is [idealistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_(ethics)).
It falls into the same realm of concepts as principles and values -
mental constructs that we attempt to apply to our lives because we
believe, on some level, that allowing those principles and values to
guide our lives will result in a better quality of life for us.
It is also idealistic because, as we all know too well, it does not
measurably exist in our practical, everyday reality.

Many principles and values are self-focused, such as integrity, whereas
values such as equality are social (the value of equality has no
meaning in a universe where you're the sole inhabitant). As such,
what I think we're saying when we "believe in equality" is that,
on some level, we believe that actively focusing on and pursuing
equality will result in a better life for all. One could interpret
this to mean: "a better life for all in South Africa", or "a better
life for all on Earth".

#### Equality poses difficult problems
The first problem with this thinking is when it hits practical reality.
What if, for example, you're currently in a position of significant
privilege (of no fault of your own), and pursuing equality would mean
giving up some, or all, of that privilege to give others a chance, thus
actually decreasing your own quality of life? In our culture of rampant
[individualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism), we are
encouraged to pursue our own individual advancement and enhancement
of our individual quality of life. When two values (individual
advancement and social equality, in this case) conflict, how do you
resolve that conflict? Which takes precedence?

The second problem is: what exactly does equality mean, practically,
when there's very little way for you, as an individual, to really
grasp the social conditions of millions (or even billions) of other
people whom you [can't possibly know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)
and where you struggle to gather data on them individually?
Even if you manage to facilitate equality within your own community,
it's entirely possible that that community will end up having far fewer
(or more) privileges and opportunities as compared to another community
within the same country. Inevitably, someone's going to fall through the
cracks and is going to be treated unequally in relation to someone else.

The third problem is that we don't all live in a homogeneous
physical environment. That is, we don't all live close enough to
a water source to get clean drinking water. We don't all live in
countries or cities with natural resources that we can exploit. We
don't all live in the same kinds of climates that facilitate the
production of the same kinds of foods. In short: we don't live in
a physical world that promotes equality. The only way that nature seems
to tend towards "equality" is to ensure, by way of the
[second law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics),
that everything is eventually broken down and destroyed.

#### Discrimination
In light of these kinds of, arguably intractable, problems, we start
defining equality in terms of its opposite: **discrimination**. As such,
we start focusing all of our time and effort on fighting discrimination,
but since human beings cannot think in terms of negatives, our very
focus on removing discrimination is what ends up facilitating it.

Just think of the challenges faced by such policies as
[BBBEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad-Based_Black_Economic_Empowerment),
where [fronting](http://polity.org.za/article/bee-a-change-for-the-better-2011-09-02)
is commonplace in South African businesses today. This, in turn,
has a tendency to create and empower a black minority and further
bolsters inequality as an unintended side-effect.

We cannot walk forwards to where we want to go by constantly looking
backwards to where we don't want to go again.

## Privilege
This brings me to the problem of privilege. There's been

[media](http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2016-03-03-the-invictus-myth-exposed-we-need-to-talk-about-white-violence/#.WEaiN5KOwmc)
over the past year or so. I pointed out in a
[post](/2015/03/02/on-white-privilege/) last year that we need to
evolve from looking at "white" privilege in isolation because it not
only breeds racial thinking and further discrimination, it also neglects
the underlying reality that **privilege is a fundamentally human
social dynamic**. We need a totally different way of looking at
society to be able to deal with it effectively.

#### Privilege facilitates discrimination
By its very nature, *making use of* one's privileges tends to facilitate
discrimination in our present society. Say, for example, one lived in
a highly unequal society where it was impossible for most people to
afford good quality education (such as South Africa). If my parents had
truckloads of money (which they didn't, but let's say for argument's
sake they did), and I wanted to go study to further myself, by way
of the current individualistic societal narrative I would be considered
utterly stupid by all of the people closest to me if I decided to
forgo that opportunity.

#### Privilege facilitates privilege
In addition to this, working towards a "better life for one's
children" (read: *working to give your children more privileges*) would,
by definition, eventually facilitate discrimination. Your
children would possibly end up with more access to finances, and
therefore opportunities, than the vast majority of other children
in the country. In this way, privilege is handed down from generation
to generation. But would you intentionally put your children at a
disadvantage in order to ensure that there is equality? Because there's
no way you would ever have the resources at your disposal to bring
millions of other people up to the same level as your own children.
And would you ever put your children at a disadvantage to give
others' children an advantage?

Unfortunately, giving up on one's privilege to facilitate equality
with others will, naturally, only breed poverty (at least in the
short term). It will possibly breed some solidarity for a while, but we
can only speculate as to whether this solidarity will assist the
community in the long run towards greater, and more homogeneous,
privilege and prosperity. Think of this as the **reset option**. I
cannot, unfortunately, think that people in positions of privilege today
would be willing to subject themselves to that, especially since there's
no guarantee that it will ultimately do any good.

## The Inner Perspective
What makes you, personally, **feel** privileged? There is obvious
practicality to the notion of privilege, and it is entirely possible
to have real-world privilege and not **feel** privileged.
But say now you had to look around you and think about what makes you
feel *privileged*. What has to happen within you, personally, for you to
experience the shade of the emotion of gratitude that we call privilege?
Let's unpack this a little.

It would seem to me as though this particular shade of gratitude
is social in nature. It isn't just a feeling of gratitude: it's a
feeling of gratitude for something in particular in relation to
other people (real or imagined). You feel privileged when you know
you have access to something that you want, that many others also want,
but to which most of those others don't have access.

Let's analyse this flow of thoughts and feelings into two broad
processes: **gratitude**, and then **social comparison**.

#### Gratitude
If you were to think about all the things for which you are grateful in
life, that leaves you with the feeling and experience of gratitude,
which is great,
[healthy](http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/in-praise-of-gratitude)
and necessary. I think there's a deep, bodily wisdom as to why human
beings have had so many
[feasts and ceremonies of thanks-giving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving)
throughout our species' history. This inner motion is thus healthy
for yourself individually, and seems to be encouraged by the
medical and psychological fraternities in modern medicine today.

#### Social comparison
Now, if you choose to start comparing yourself to others, you're
going to get a rough sense in one of three feelings: that you're
**worse off** than others, that you're doing **okay** relative to
others, or that you're **better off** than others.

The trouble with feeling worse off is that it tends to facilitate
feelings of **anger** or **resentment**. Anger is a powerful emotion
towards motivating someone towards taking radical action, like banding
together with others who feel the same, and overthrowing the elite
whom they feel is more privileged than them. This is further bolstered
by deep-seated emotional issues as a result of generations of abuse and
neglect - part of the ugly fallout of the apartheid regime.

Then, the trouble with feeling better off is that it tends to
facilitate feelings of **guilt**, and potentially even **fear** that
others will want to take what we have. We can can respond in several
ways to these feelings. Firstly, we could try to ignore it. This takes
an increasing amount of effort over time, and has the tendency to
numb ourselves to the suffering of others. If numbness does not come
easily, we resort to anger and lashing out. This, I think, is why
so many white people's comments to the recent spate of articles on
"white privilege" in South Africa are so filled with anger and outrage.

Secondly, we could try to escape it by leaving the province or country
to go to some place where we feel more "equal" to others in terms of
privilege (at least in our immediate community). Although there are
very often positive reasons as to why privileged people live South
Africa, as there could be some incredible opportunity for them and their
families elsewhere, I get the sense that many people who have left the
country already, or are looking to leave, are just tired of feeling
guilty and afraid.

Thirdly, we can look at this in a positive light and use it as a
motivational force towards action to try to give others around us access
to more opportunity (the *pay-it-forward* approach). This is the most
difficult option, because it forces one to take responsibility for
the fact that one lives in a society of extremely unequal sets of
privileges, across the ethnic spectrum. The scale of the challenge in
South Africa specifically is also, unfortunately, so large that no
single person can have a significant impact to the country in its
entirety. It therefore requires **collective action**.

## Moving Forward
The trouble with collective action towards something positive is
that it's like an entire stadium of people all standing up together
at a sporting event. Most of the time, this results in people behind
them not being able to see at all. If you elect to "do the right thing"
and sit down, it's highly unlikely it's going to encourage the people
around you to do the same, which means you'll be the only poor soul
sitting down not being able to see anything at all.

#### Individual vs government action
This is the analogy sometimes used by economists who advocate for
governments to be able to intervene at large scales, as some kind of
authority needs to encourage people to act together towards the greater
good. This is a classic case of a *threshold* in social life where,
below which, there's no real benefit to the individual to act in the
interests of the greater community.

It'd certainly be great if the South African government could come to
the party and focus on the real issues affecting communities. Since
meaningful change doesn't seem any closer than it was a decade ago
in South Africa, with
[inequality only increasing over the last decade](http://www.chartbookofeconomicinequality.com/inequality-by-country/south-africa/),
it doesn't seem as though government is going to help in this regard.
In fact, some people claim that our current government has a
[vested interest in protecting privilege](http://www.news24.com/Columnists/MaxduPreez/be-careful-of-how-you-criticise-zuma-20161129).

#### The power of local community
I believe that all is not lost though. We're so conditioned into
dualistic thinking in society today that we tend to see everything
in life as *either/or* instead of shades of grey. Why does it need to
be a case of *either* pure individual action *or* government action?
Why can't there be something in between?

One thing we learn from the study of [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)
is that sometimes the collective action of smaller communities can,
on the whole, result in a completely new and different dynamic.
Especially when, after the communities have been able to establish
new behaviours, they come into contact with each other to further
bolster the positive behaviours on a larger scale.

My strong belief is that we need to band together as smaller communities
in South Africa: start talking to your friends, family and colleagues
about this. Ask the question: **What can we do, as a small group, to
help people in our immediate vicinity?** If you can't find like-minded
people in your immediate vicinity, but feel you have relevant skills
you'd like to contribute, reach out to relevant organisations in those
spheres.

For me, personally, since I can write software, I'm trying to get
more involved in events like the
[Kent Beck Project](http://kbp.jcse.org.za/), and want to start
contributing my skills in more meaningful ways to non-profits. I'm
already having these sorts of conversations with colleagues and
friends. I'm hoping that once my community is more active in
contributing towards a better life for others, we'll start connecting
with other such communities in South Africa.

Just try it. You'd be amazed at how willing people are to
**get involved**.
