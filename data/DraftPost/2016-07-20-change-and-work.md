title: Change and Work
slug: change-and-work
summary: |
  Change is such an important part of life. As the old saying goes,
  "the only constant in life is change". From my experience in technology,
  it would seem as though the tech industry embraces this. But does it, really?
  And, if so, what could other industries learn from this?

It usually seems to me as though, at least on a philosophical level, the
tech industry seems to be at the forefront of many things. This includes
its approach to managing change. The principles embodied in, for example,
the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) are powerful ideas that
embrace the nature of change. By and large, many mature software developers
I've encountered tend to embrace such change. This creates a certain culture
within the software development community that also seems to filter into:

* the types of tools we build and continuously modify to communicate (to name
  just a few: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/),
  [Arg&uuml;man](http://en.arguman.org/),
  [Slack](https://slack.com/) and
  [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)),
* the types of tools we build to share what we're building (such as
  [Git](https://git-scm.com/)),
* the types of approaches and tools we develop to facilitate continuous
  improvement and delivery in our products (such as
  [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) and [Go.CD](https://www.go.cd)),
