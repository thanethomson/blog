It's one thing to write a Python library or application that you
find useful for yourself personally, but what if you want to release it
into the open source community in the most frictionless way possible
for new users to adopt it? From my recent experience in open-sourcing
several Python libraries
([Statik](https://github.com/thanethomson/statik),
[passwdgen](https://github.com/thanethomson/passwdgen),
[lipsum](https://github.com/thanethomson/lipsum),
[httpwatcher](https://github.com/thanethomson/httpwatcher) and
[python-brewer](https://github.com/thanethomson/python-brewer)), I
thought I'd try to distil my learnings into a guide for new Python
open source contributors.

## Preliminary Questions
There are a number of preliminary questions to ask yourself about
your project before you begin.
