The definition of a "blanket term" from
[Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blanket_term):

> A word or phrase that is used to describe multiple groups of related things.
The degree of relation may vary. Blanket terms often trade specificity for
ease-of-use; in other words, a blanket term by itself gives little detail
about the things that it describes or the relationships between them, but is
easy to say and remember...

The funny thing about language is its ability to take on a life of its own
(from social constructionist and postmodern points of view, the meanings of
words morph over time as society and people do).

There are a number of important examples of this. One example of this is "the
organisation" or "the company", these being blanket terms to represent a group
of people. As per
[this lecture](http://rickroderick.org/307-derrida-and-the-ends-of-man-1993/)
by Rick Roderick on Derrida's _deconstruction_, words gain
their significance in being able to act _in the absence of things_, not to
refer to them (one does not need a horse in the room to talk about a horse).
Thus, words need not refer to something of tangible substance.

This all seems quite obvious. But why then do we assume that an entity known
as an "organisation" actually exists? Why do we spend so much time analysing
and dissecting its dynamics and teaching these dynamics to people in business
school? Surely an "organisation" is a blanket term used to refer to a group of
people who share some kind of agreement of association in working together (or
not working together)? Similarly, an "industry" is a blanket term to refer to
what seems to be the collective actions of a variety of individuals with
relatively common activities?

The problem I have with blanket terms is as follows.

1. We construct a blanket term to represent a grouping of things in order to
   simplify reality (e.g. "organisation"), effectively giving the blanket term
   (and corresponding imagined entity) a life of its own.
2. By observation and experimentation, we attempt to isolate the dynamics of
   this entity, which is actually just a convenient abstraction of reality (see
   my article on the
   [process-oriented view of reality](https://thanethomson.com/2011/11/08/reality-as-process/)).
3. We eventually become very comfortable with these entities as having lives of
   their own, treating them as such (we attempt to control or direct these
   entities towards our ends), inventing a variety of frameworks along the way
   towards these ends (e.g. "organisational design", "change management",
   "industry forces", "financial accounting", "corporate strategy").
4. We get so comfortable with the frameworks that companies fail and/or fail to
   create value for society, primarily because we didn't understand the
   composition of the organisation that is truly amenable to the applied
   frameworks. We assumed this "organisation" thing to have a life and
   character similar to other "organisations", where in "reality", there were
   two quite dissimilar groups of people - individuals with their own unique
   characters, motivations, hopes and dreams, and power dynamics between the
   people, heavily influenced by culture and background.

Perhaps some frameworks cannot be applied to certain types of groupings of
people? Perhaps we should be interrogating the underlying assumptions of all
of our frameworks and defining domains and/or situations where these
frameworks are applicable? Many frameworks attempt to factor in culture or
background, but most of them seem to do so rather weakly.

This, unfortunately, does not bode well for those who want to construct
"organisations" as perpetual money-making machines/systems. Forever more, as
per Derrida's thinking, our philosophy (and thus the implementation thereof)
will need "tidying up".

And, you will never, ever, _ever_ escape the detail - reality is complex, and
we need to be careful of how we talk about it, in case we inadvertently harm
each other's children, or children's children, by way of our careless, lazy
chatter.
