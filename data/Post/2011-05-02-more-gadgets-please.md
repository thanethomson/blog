After many years’ struggle through multiple failed businesses, Evan finally
caught wind of an idea that could make him some decent money. His wife’s eyes
were weary from the late bill payments, repeated pleading with debt collectors,
and her deep longing to start a family of her own that she had put off for five
long years now due to numerous fights over financial security.

She was naturally sceptical of this idea, but Evan was a gifted salesman, and
managed to charm her into giving him one last shot. "If this one doesn't work
Ev, you’re going back to being an accountant for at least the next ten to
fifteen years - until the kids are old enough to not need so much security."

Although he understood the practical implications of having children, and that
he had a skill that could address those practical needs, he also knew it would
probably kill him inside to have to go back to a grey, rigid desk job like that.
He felt the incongruence of these two conflicting desires well up inside him in
the form of nausea.

His idea was certainly something for which there seemed to be a market: it
existed in the overlap between two different market segments served only by
four very cumbersome multinationals, and he had hard evidence of thousands of
customer pleas for something which addressed exactly this overlap. He also had
the network to pull together the man-power and resources to get a prototype
going and get the finance, as well as the swiftness that only a relatively
small operation could have to tackle the profit-bloated, complacent
multinationals.

He wasn’t convinced of the longevity of the idea though, as it involved making
a particular type of gadget which would add non-critical functionality to
high-end mobile phones - a niche market; a nice-to-have. But, by his
calculations, he could probably make enough money for him and his family to
live comfortably for at least the next three to five years or so, giving him
time to come up with another idea.

Is it "the system" which drives us to want more and more? How is it that this
"system" has come into being, and what is its true nature and character? Should
the desires for autonomy and security conflict as in the example sketched above?

I don't personally have complete, accurate answers to the above questions just
yet, but, looking at the nature and structure of the economy as I understand it
at the moment, I can conjecture.

It would seem as though the systemic, mechanistic perspective (as per the
definition by Stacey, 2007) is to blame here. This perspective pervades any
large organisation bent on control of its employees, as if they were cogs in
a machine, without autonomy or the capacity for novelty.

Perhaps I am naive, but I am not thoroughly convinced that top management
initially makes a conscious decision to treat their employees as though they
were black boxes with inputs and outputs and useful lifetimes - as "resources".
Something tells me that this is an oversight, and a by-product of reductionist
thinking which has permeated society for hundreds of years, but this point is
certainly up for debate.

Inside of himself, a manager of a non-manufacturing business says: "I've got to
meet these targets because my job's on the line if I don't. How do I get my team
to pull together and be more efficient? Perhaps there's a bottleneck somewhere
in the process..."

Who sets these targets? Why these targets? Why think of one's team in terms of
"bottlenecks" and "processes", as though they were a non-autonomous, unfeeling
system of some kind?

Many to whom I’ve expressed this opinion say to me: "That's nice in an ideal
world, but how the heck do you intend on getting anything done?"

Who says we have to get anything done? And what is it that we should be getting
done? Should we be building gadgets and trinkets, or should we be working on
ways to accommodate the world's growing population, in terms of first meeting
their basic needs?

The problem is, there seems to be no money in the business of meeting people's
basic needs, because people with such basic needs generally don’t have the money
to pay for those needs to be met. There are examples, however, of low-cost
"base of the pyramid" solutions that help fulfil such basic needs, but these
seem to require tremendous capital outlays and extremely rigid standardisation
processes, often resulting in very large barriers to entry. Who is going to pay
for the meeting of those needs?

Should helping others in dire need be the secondary aim of our profit-making
structures, thereby "looking out for number one" first? Or should our primary
aim be to help uplift those around us (not at all by way of charity - by way of
true upliftment towards self-sufficiency)?

Surely the pursuit of profit is merely a proxy for pursuit of meaningful human
connection? What more do we need than food, water, shelter and diverse,
meaningful relationships?

I suppose posturing and desire for power, influence and prominence come into
the argument at this point. I still have much research to do into power dynamics
in society, although so far I feel it is exactly this need for influence and
power, perhaps control and security to some degree, that has precipitated and
perpetuated the systemic mindset.

Evan, the entrepreneur, is unfortunately stuck right now with the development
of the gadget: the thing we don't need on which we spend money we don't have to
impress people we don't give a damn about, until such time that he has enough
money to break this spiraling cycle.
