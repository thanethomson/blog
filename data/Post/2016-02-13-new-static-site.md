After playing around with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for a while, I
decided against it in favour of [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) for a variety of
reasons. Mostly subjective, gut-feel-based ones, as are quality reasonings
in general.

For the most part, both static site generators work really well. Both generate
static sites. Both support custom themes. Both support differentiation between
posts and other types of content. Both effectively allow for most functionality
relating to blogging. Jekyll does seem to have a bigger, more established
community, but Hugo's is growing. So in terms of functionality at least they're
matched in my mind and for my purposes.

Ultimately, it would seem my mind was made up after my recent forays into the
[Go](http://golang.org) programming language. Having started programming in C
at quite a young age, coding in Go evokes all sorts of warm fuzzy feelings.

Check out this little `Go` code snippet:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Printf("Hello world!\n")
}
```

I mean, doesn't that `Printf` command just make you all nostalgic?
Isn't that a thing of beauty that can and should inspire one to subjectively
choose one static site generator over another?
Just me? Ah, okay then <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
