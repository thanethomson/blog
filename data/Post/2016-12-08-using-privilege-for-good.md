summary: >
  With South Africa being a country of extreme inequality, we need a
  totally different way of looking at society to be able to deal with
  it effectively. We need to stop thinking dualistically.
  We need to spend more time cultivating a habit of being grateful
  for what we have, while using our tendency towards social comparison
  to motivate us to positive, empowering action. We need to focus on
  local community instead of individual action, or waiting for
  government or business to "do the right thing".

over the past year or so in South Africa. I pointed out in a
[post](/2015/03/02/on-white-privilege/) last year that we need to
evolve from looking at "white" privilege in isolation because it not
only breeds racial thinking and further discrimination, it also neglects
the underlying reality that **privilege is a fundamentally human
social dynamic**.

We need a totally different way of looking at society to be able to deal
with it effectively. We need to stop
[thinking dualistically](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-tsilimparis/stress-and-dualistic-mind_b_978230.html).
We need to spend more time cultivating a habit of being grateful
for what we have, while using our tendency towards social comparison
to motivate us to positive, empowering action. We need to focus on
local community instead of individual action, or waiting for government
or business to "do the right thing". We all know they have a tendency
to favour their own self-serving motives over the well-being of
the community.[^1]

## The Inner Perspective
What makes you, personally, **feel** privileged? There is obvious
practicality to the notion of privilege, and it is entirely possible
to have real-world privilege and not **feel** privileged.
But say now you had to look around you and think about what makes you
feel *privileged*. What has to happen within you, personally, for you to
experience the shade of the emotion of gratitude that we call privilege?
Let's unpack this a little.

It would seem to me as though this particular shade of gratitude
is social in nature. It isn't just a feeling of gratitude: it's a
feeling of gratitude for something in particular in relation to
other people (real or imagined). You feel privileged when you know
you have access to something that you want, that many others also want,
but to which most of those others don't have access.

Let's analyse this flow of thoughts and feelings into two broad
processes: **gratitude**, and then **social comparison**.

#### Gratitude
If you were to think about all the things for which you are grateful in
life, that leaves you with the feeling and experience of gratitude,
which is great,
[healthy](http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/in-praise-of-gratitude)
and necessary. I think there's a deep, bodily wisdom as to why human
beings have had so many
[feasts and ceremonies of thanks-giving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving)
throughout our species' history. This inner motion is thus healthy
for yourself individually, and seems to be encouraged by the
medical and psychological fraternities in modern medicine today.

#### Social comparison
Now, if you choose to start comparing yourself to others, you're
going to get a rough sense in one of three feelings: that you're
**worse off** than others, that you're doing **okay** relative to
others, or that you're **better off** than others.

The trouble with feeling worse off is that it tends to facilitate
feelings of **anger** or **resentment**. Anger is a powerful emotion
towards motivating someone towards taking radical action, like banding
together with others who feel the same, and overthrowing the elite
whom they feel is more privileged than them. This is further bolstered
by deep-seated emotional issues as a result of generations of abuse and
neglect - part of the ugly fallout of the apartheid regime.

Then, the trouble with feeling better off is that it tends to
facilitate feelings of **guilt**, and potentially even **fear** that
others will want to take what we have. We can can respond in several
ways to these feelings. Firstly, we could try to ignore it. This takes
an increasing amount of effort over time, and has the tendency to
numb ourselves to the suffering of others. If numbness does not come
easily, we resort to anger and lashing out. This, I think, is why
so many white people's comments to the recent spate of articles on
"white privilege" in South Africa are so filled with anger and outrage.

Secondly, we could try to escape it by leaving the province or country
to go to some place where we feel more "equal" to others in terms of
privilege (at least in our immediate community). Although there are
very often positive reasons as to why privileged people leave South
Africa, as there could be some incredible opportunity for them and their
families elsewhere, I get the sense that many people who have left the
country already, or are looking to leave, are just tired of feeling
guilty and afraid.

Thirdly, we can look at this in a positive light and use it as a
motivational force towards action to try to give others around us access
to more opportunity (the **pay-it-forward** approach). This is the most
difficult option, because it forces one to take responsibility for
the fact that one lives in a society of extremely unequal sets of
privileges, across the ethnic spectrum. The scale of the challenge in
South Africa specifically is also, unfortunately, so large that no
single person can have a significant impact to the country in its
entirety. It therefore requires **collective action**.

## Moving Forward
The trouble with collective action towards something positive is
that it's like an entire stadium of people all standing up together
at a sporting event. Most of the time, this results in people behind
each row of standing people having their view of the game blocked,
and a collectively shitty experience for everyone except those in
the front row. If you elect to "do the right thing" and sit down, it's
highly unlikely it's going to encourage the people around you to do the
same, which means you'll be the only poor soul sitting down not being
able to see anything at all.

#### Individual vs government action
This is the analogy sometimes used by economists who advocate for
governments to be able to intervene at large scales, as some kind of
authority needs to encourage people to act together towards the greater
good. This is a classic case of a *threshold* in social life where,
below which, there's no real benefit to the individual to act in the
interests of the greater community.

It'd certainly be great if the South African government could come to
the party and focus on the real issues affecting communities. Since
meaningful change doesn't seem any closer than it was a decade ago
in South Africa, with
[inequality only increasing over the last decade](http://www.chartbookofeconomicinequality.com/inequality-by-country/south-africa/),
it doesn't seem as though government is going to help in this regard.
In fact, some people claim that our current government has a
[vested interest in protecting privilege](http://www.news24.com/Columnists/MaxduPreez/be-careful-of-how-you-criticise-zuma-20161129).

#### The power of local community
I believe that all is not lost though. We're so conditioned into
[dualistic thinking](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-tsilimparis/stress-and-dualistic-mind_b_978230.html)
in society today that we tend to see everything
in life as *either/or* instead of shades of grey or more subtle,
nuanced, complex solutions. Why does it need to be a case of, in our
example here, *either* pure individual action *or* government action?
Why can't there be something in between?

One thing we learn from the study of
[cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)
is that sometimes the collective action of smaller communities can,
on the whole, result in a completely new and different dynamic.
Especially when, after the communities have been able to establish
new behaviours, they come into contact with each other to further
bolster the positive behaviours on a larger scale.

My strong belief is that we need to band together as smaller communities
in South Africa: start talking to your friends, family and colleagues
about this. Ask the question: **What can we do, as a small group, to
help people in our immediate vicinity?** If you can't find like-minded
people in your immediate vicinity, but feel you have relevant skills
you'd like to contribute, reach out to relevant organisations in those
spheres.

Coming back to our analogy of the sporting event: the equivalent would
be having a chat with the few people around you, getting them to be
aware of the problem (to **see the value in taking action**),
getting them to see that there's something they can do about it, and
encouraging them to talk to those around them too.

Of course, there will be those assholes who will just ignore you
or be downright rude to you, but I've found in reality that they're
few and far between. And once you've encouraged enough people around
them to sit down, peer pressure will kick in and they'll be forced to
sit down too. Even those people in the front row will have to sit
down too, or suffer the wrath of the stadium.

## Getting Started
For me, personally, since I can write software, I'm trying to get
more involved by taking part in events like the
[Kent Beck Project](http://kbp.jcse.org.za/), and want to start
contributing my skills in more meaningful ways to non-profits. I'm
already having these sorts of conversations with colleagues and
friends. I'm hoping that once my community is more active in
contributing towards a better life for others, we'll start connecting
with other such communities in South Africa.

Just try it. You'd be amazed at how willing people are to
**get involved**.

    Just take a look at [this article](http://hsf.org.za/resource-centre/hsf-briefs/the-distribution-of-income-and-the-distribution-of-wealth-in-south-africa-part-i-the-facts)
    from the Helen Suzman Foundation. It appears as though nearly
    75% of the wealth in South Africa is concentrated in the hands of
    10% of the people. Of that 75%, it appears as though 70% is tied up
    in **financial assets**. Judging from the incredibly high levels
    of [indebtedness](https://www.bis.org/ifc/publ/ifcb26c.pdf) of
    the average South African, our steadily high
    [unemployment rate](https://businesstech.co.za/news/business/109959/this-graphic-shows-the-shocking-state-of-employment-in-south-africa/)
    (with [real unemployment](http://www.politicsweb.co.za/opinion/what-is-south-africas-real-unemployment-rate)
    potentially being far higher than the reported statistics),
    and our terrible
    [inequality](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=ife8n327iup1s_&ctype=b&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=s&met_y=indicator_103706&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&met_x=indicator_137506&scale_x=lin&ind_x=false&ifdim=country&ind=false&icfg#!ctype=b&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=s&met_y=indicator_137506&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&met_x=indicator_101706&scale_x=lin&ind_x=false&idim=country:19303:2703:17203:9203:4103&ifdim=country&pit=1386540000000&hl=en_US&dl=en_US&ind=false),
    it doesn't seem to me as though these financial assets are being
    used effectively to create
    [real wealth](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/05/29/alan-watts-on-money-vs-wealth/)
    for the overall population. Note that these figures refer
    specifically to **personal** financial wealth, and not corporate
    wealth (although the lines between these types of wealth are
    probably quite blurred when considering many high-net-worth
    individuals' declared assets are in shares in companies). And this
    is only what's
    [actually](http://mg.co.za/article/2014-04-16-sars-losing-out-on-rich-pickings)
    [been](http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/sars-wins-war-on-tax-dodgers-1748172)
    [declared](https://panamapapers.icij.org/).

    I'm most certainly not advocating for communism - I wholeheartedly
    believe that communism is a failed ideology precisely because it
    ignores the dynamics of human
    [power](/tags/power/) and social influence. But I do tend to agree
    with [Russell Brand](https://www.youtube.com/user/russellbrand) in
    that things do need to be a little more equal across the spectrum.
    How equal, exactly? That's still a topic for debate and research.
