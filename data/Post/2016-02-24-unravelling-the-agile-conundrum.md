  I've been trying to figure out what exactly people mean by "Agile" (in
  their implementation of it, as opposed to the definitions in the manifesto),
  as well as where it's actually applicable.

Lately I've been wondering a lot about this whole
[Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
[debate](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5406384), where it's applicable
and where not. I'm trying to absorb as much as I possibly can about the art and
science of software development, from its roots in human thinking and
philosophy and management science, through to its underlying technical
componentry, in the hope that it'll make me a better craftsman. When looking
at this debate over whether or not Agile "works", I can't help but feel a
little overwhelmed. Do I invest my time and effort into learning processes
and building habits that will ultimately not profit me? The fact that this
debate still rages on in the first place says to me that we've possibly
gotten a whiff of value coming from the Agile direction, but can't quite
place our finger on what that tasty new smell is.

When confronted with large quantities of information, I try to go back to what
I think are the "basics" (in my case, deeper levels of abstraction and a focus
on *values* and *value*). Broadly speaking, Agile is a class of *processes*,
and processes by their very nature are structures (in our thinking, habits,
communication patterns, etc.) that are meant to facilitate the extraction of
*value* in a somewhat repeatable way. That is, we want to to be able to take
those processes that facilitate value extraction (e.g. working software with
happy clients and happy engineers) in one environment, and apply them to
another environment with similar results.

Management science in general has this somewhat dubious appearance to me in
that we try to apply the kind of rigorous scientific thinking that we apply
to the domains of physics, chemistry and biology, which all have had pretty
regular processes and structures in place for many billions of years, to
the social domain, which is barely in its infancy right now when looking
at humanity in context. And for what? To control it? To guarantee some level
of predictability and repeatability?

Of course, we can't throw all critical thinking on the management science front
out - I think some of it definitely does benefit us, when **relevant**. But
we need to keep our context in mind, and a sense of humility and openness to
experience and correction. We're all effectively still experimenting here,
trying to grope around in the dark in search of these potentially repeatable
processes that continue to elude us.

I think the best summary I've seen so far of where Agile succeeds and
where it fails is probably
[Michael O. Church's article](https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2015/06/06/why-agile-and-especially-scrum-are-terrible/)
on why Agile and Scrum are terrible. One of the deep reasons why it fails
so horribly is that people try to apply Agile processes to social
environments that are "Waterfall" by their very nature (i.e. the "fun" or
"interesting" work gets progressively picked off as the work trickles down
the bureaucratic hierarchy, leaving engineers with nothing but lifeless
implementation work and little to no meaningful connection with the end
customer/client). Church calls this "business-driven" business, as opposed
to "engineer-driven" business. If you apply Agile processes to a
"business-driven" business, all you get is sloppy, undisciplined Waterfall.

In short, it looks as though the simple rule is, if your company's
*existing* approach to making things for customers already aligns really well
with the [12 Agile Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html), then
Agile processes are a good fit for your environment. Otherwise, you're going to
need to keep searching. Or change your company (in either or both senses of the
expression).
