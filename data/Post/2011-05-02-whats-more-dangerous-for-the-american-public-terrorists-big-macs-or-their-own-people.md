People killed in September 11 attacks: 3,000 + US deaths (civilian+military)
from the "War on Terror": 8,800 = 11,800 deaths (over 10 years).

Major causes of death in the US in 2007 alone: 616,067 (heart disease) +
562,875 (cancer) + 135,952 (strokes) = 1,314,894 (just in 2007). This equals
111 times the number of people killed in September 11 and the whole "War on
Terror". Note that homicides accounted for 18,361 deaths in the US just in
2007 alone (1.5 times the number of people killed from September 11 and the
whole "War on Terror").

And now an entire nation
[celebrates the death of another human being](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1382652/Osama-Bin-Laden-killed-America-celebrates-Ground-Zero-White-House.html),
the pinnacle of $1.2 trillion dollars' spending in the "War on Terror".
