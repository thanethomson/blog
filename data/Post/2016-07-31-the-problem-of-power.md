title: The Problem of Power
slug: the-problem-of-power
summary: >
  Thinking about the propagation of any particular ideology, or more broadly,
  any framework of thinking (and potentially even feeling), we simply can't
  ignore the role of power and social influence. It seems far too hard-wired
  into our very humanity.

How exactly do ideologies and frameworks of thinking propagate
through society? It may seem like an odd question at first, but I've had this
theory for a few years now that they **tend to propagate along the lines carved
out for them by power and social influence**.

### Let's Start with Religion
For example, how exactly did Christianity or Islam spread to encompass [31.5%
and 23.2% of the whole world's population by
2010](http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/),
respectively? Was
it purely on the merit of the soundness of their philosophies? Was it based on
cold, hard facts and logic? I somehow don't think so. More likely, I think, is
the possibility that they spread by way of power and influence. Specifically,
looking into some of the [history of
Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_and_violence), as well
as the  [history of
Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Muslim_conquests), it seems as though
they were spread by way of, or indirectly as a result of, violence. At least
initially they were, until they became so much a way of life for so many people
that spreading these religions' frameworks of thinking and feeling to their
children was easy.

### A Hint from Social Media
Let's zoom back to the present. Look at the Twitter accounts of
[Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk),
[Donald Trump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump),
[Barack Obama](https://twitter.com/BarackObama), just
to name a few - how many *millions* of followers do each of them have? What
kind of platform does this give them to share their ideas? Did people follow
them on Twitter because they had good ideas, or because they were already
influential?

This is one of the most powerful, and simultaneously deceptive properties
of social media: it gives people a voice. I've tried searching for up-to-date
statistics on how many followers the average Twitter user has, but all I could
come up with, and the primary source of this number for most articles on
the internet, was this
[heavily out-of-date article from The Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9601327/Average-Twitter-user-is-an-an-American-woman-with-an-iPhone-and-208-followers.html)
which states that the number is **208** (back in 2012).

So yes, social media does give people a voice, but it certainly doesn't
democratise people's thinking. It seems a little redundant to say it, but I
think it's worth pointing out that influential people have far more **reach**
than the average person when it comes to broadcasting their thinking. This is
by no means a failing on the part of
social media - technology is just a tool, like a spade. We are the ones who
wield it, and so our use of it has a tendency to follow our natural human
tendencies. The particular tendency in question here, of course, is our
innate, instinctive, subconscious drive towards
[allocating and deallocating power/influence to/from others](http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~keltner/publications/keltner.advances.2008.pdf).

### The Media, Government and Big Corporate
[Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky) has written
extensively on the topic of power (and its various forms of abuse) in society.
He's written and spoken extensively on
[the role of the media](https://www.amazon.com/Manufacturing-Consent-Noam-Chomsky-Media/dp/B0031DDI4I),
governments and big corporations in filtering ideas and thinking in such a way
that shields the population from issues that would be important to them, while
furthering the interests of an elite minority. The controlling individuals
in these various, highly influential groups of people have a tremendous amount
of reach when it comes to broadcasting their thinking (or, rather, their
desires for how everybody else should think).

What's even scarier is the **active** and **deliberate** action on the part
of various governments and corporations to invade people's privacy in order
to improve the *feedback mechanism* for the ways in which they want to broadcast
their thinking.

### The Role of Critical Thinking
I'm not at all ruling out the possibility that some people critically
evaluate the content of someone else's ideas and make up their minds based
on a more "objective" view of the quality of the ideas themselves, but this
doesn't seem to be the norm in society. To quote
[Kierkegaard](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/11/26/kierkegaard-individual-crowd-conformity-minority/):

> Truth always rests with the minority, and the minority is always stronger than
the majority, because the minority is generally formed by those who really have
an opinion, while the strength of a majority is illusory, formed by the gangs
who have no opinion - and who, therefore, in the next instant (when it is
evident that the minority is the stronger) assume its opinion, which then
becomes that of the majority, i.e., becomes nonsense by having the whole [mass]
on its side, while Truth again reverts to a new minority.

### What About the Good Ideas?
Alright then - so what? So what if the power to broadcast ideas is left in the
hands of very few people? It should be patently obvious by now to anyone who's
been awake and paying attention to world events over the past decade that,
**just because someone is influential, does not necessarily mean that their
ideas are good or healthy for society**.

This brings us to the challenge of finding the **good ideas** - the ones
that will help us grow as individuals, meet our needs, live sustainably
together as a society, or whatever you would consider to be "good". To
quote an excellent [recent article by Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/crazy-world):

> Instead, I am attempting to go back to learning about the world only through
long-form journalism that has been thoroughly researched and vetted before being
published. I'm exercising the muscles in my brain responsible for focus, depth,
and concentration. I'm stretching out my logic, trying to challenge my own
beliefs and always holding on to a healthy amount of doubt.<br /><br />
> Is this far less convenient and way more time consuming? Yes, it is. Does it
make me feel like a cranky old man to all my friends? Yeah, it does.

### Whose Ideas Win?
If we take Kierkegaard's observation seriously, and acknowledge this dynamic of
various minorities birthing ideas, which eventually and only sometimes, under
the right conditions, seem to propagate to the masses by way of channels of
power and influence, whose ideas will win in the end?

I personally don't see an end to this struggle. As society evolves and changes,
no matter how much technology helps to facilitate an increased rate of
allocation or deallocation of power to/from deserving/undeserving individuals, I
think there'll always be a tension between the ideas of the minority and those
of the majority.

The minority will struggle and suffer to gain the attention of,
and deflect the violence inflicted by, the majority, while the majority will
struggle and suffer in their complacency, their laziness and apathy, and at the
hands of the powerful elites who would take advantage of them. Round and round
we'll go, and hopefully we'll head in a direction that doesn't involve us
[nuking ourselves out of existence](http://www.icanw.org/the-facts/nuclear-arsenals/).

This most certainly does not mean that we should just throw in the towel -
on the contrary, I think this means that **we all need to acknowledge and accept our
places and roles in this grand carousel, and endure the suffering we're dealt
as a result**. [The best way out is through](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Servant_to_Servants),
right?

What do you think?
