title: Goodbye, Reddit (For Now)
slug: goodbye-reddit-for-now
summary: >
  Reddit is often, and has the potential to be, a really awesome
  platform for genuine, authentic, robust conversation. But its true
  strength (and, often, failure) lies in the efficacy of its moderation
  teams. Especially when it comes to dealing with online verbal abuse.

Just the other day I posted an article that I wrote
on [Using Privilege for Good](/2016/12/08/using-privilege-for-good)
to the [South Africa subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/),
and man, was I underwhelmed with and disappointed by the response.
From following the
[Programming subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/) for
some time now, I was expecting some form of robust debate on the
topic of my post. Worst case, I thought, my post would possibly be
ignored (as is the internet's usual way of dealing with people whom they
don't understand, or with whom they don't agree, or just don't care
about, in my experience).

The response I got was for one user in particular to repeatedly lambaste
me, mock me, and personally insult my intelligence in a public forum
based on this person's misinterpretation and, in the best case,
extremely pedantic, and in the worst case, shallow,
purely theoretical understanding of the
[footnote](/2016/12/08/using-privilege-for-good/#fn:1)
in the article (I mean, FFS, it's a footnote).

His claims that my understanding of economics is akin
to that of a child's, calling me "financially illiterate", and likening
my thinking to that of
"[flat-earthers'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies)",
would be the kinds of comments at which anyone
who genuinely knows me personally would burst out laughing due to
their absurdity, or be disgusted.
If I'd been the recipient of this sort of treatment in, for example, a
meeting room full of my peers, I'm pretty confident I'd have a strong
case for instituting a
[libel lawsuit](http://mg.co.za/article/2012-11-02-00-ten-things-about-defamation)
against this individual. Not to mention the fact that, if this were
a coworker, and they treated me like this in the company of others,
I'd have a strong case to have them
[dismissed](http://www.lawyersouthafrica.co.za/warning-signs-of-verbal-abuse-at-work/).

As a self-respecting individual, and not wanting the spirit of what
I was trying to communicate in the post tainted by this person's
verbal abuse over a completely unrelated, clearly misunderstood topic,
I decided to remove the post, and all of my responses relating to it.
But why go as far as to delete my account?

## Moderators' real power
Being a moderator on a public forum like Reddit must be really
challenging. Especially on a subreddit like the *South Africa*
subreddit, where subterranean racist tendencies can easily slip out,
as anonymity here seems to be a kind of grease that lubricates that
pathway between people's innermost, deepest, darkest thoughts and their
fingers on the keyboard. It's most likely a tightrope act at times,
between the one extreme of facilitating hate speech, and the other of
engaging in destructive censorship. Reddit is also a platform that,
being initially birthed from the commendable ideologies of the
late [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz),
has built itself a brand of being a place for robust, intense,
open, often heated discussion and humour. As such, moderators are
charged with a high degree of responsibility.

I'm pretty sure, however, that Aaron Swartz didn't build Reddit in
the spirit of facilitating conversation such as the one that took
place on that thread about my post. In fact, Reddit's own
[Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) has very
specific guidelines as to what constitutes harassment:

> Harassment on Reddit is defined as systematic and/or continued actions
> to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable
> person conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their
> ideas or participate in the conversation, or fear for their safety or
> the safety of those around them.

So after contacting the moderators on the South Africa subreddit,
their response was simply that this user was being "condescending" as
opposed to harassing, despite my repeated requests to the user to
refrain from insulting me with every comment, and decided not to
act in any meaningful way to deal with the issue. And they didn't have
much hope that Reddit's global content monitoring team would feel
any different.

Now, I'm pretty sure that as a moderator on that particular subreddit
one sees a lot of crazy shit. So perhaps they are so desensitised to
this kind of treatment of others that it hardly even makes them flinch.
But, since I'd consider myself a pretty reasonable person (as would,
I believe, anyone who knows me personally), and I'd conclude that,
from this particular user's abusive treatment of me, that Reddit is most
certainly not a *safe* platform for expressing one's ideas, those
comments would be considered as harassing and bullying. In fact, one
of the moderators stated outright that that subreddit, and Reddit
in general, is not a safe place to express one's opinions (in complete
contradiction to Reddit's own policy on harassment)[^1].

This, despite Reddit's apparent recent
[crackdown on abusive members](http://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-announces-crackdown-abusive-members-ceo-steve-huffman-targeted-2016-12).

## Why be abusive toward others?
This also got me thinking about a pretty common question that I've seen
floating around the internet for a while: **Why do people so often
feel that they need to be abusive towards others on the internet?**
The majority of these people would most likely be very careful as
to what they say in real life to other human beings, but somehow,
acting from behind the comfort and safety of a computer screen, they
feel as though they're empowered, and actually entitled, to be
completely disrespectful to others.

There's a lot of debate over whether or not the internet
[should facilitate anonymity](http://thenextweb.com/me/2011/08/14/online-anonymity-a-gateway-to-freedom-or-abuse/),
and I personally believe that anonymity is a really good thing. But
where there is anonymity, there needs to be a **strong
moderation team**. A team that is capable of seeing verbal abuse for
what it is, and vehemently stamping it out, deleting abusive posts
and instructing those users to rephrase their comments in a form
that is respectful. Of course, who moderates the moderators? That's
a tough one, which is also why I understand why they'd rather err
on the side of being too permissive in allowing people to say what they
want, as opposed to being too restrictive. If there's a way for users to
report censorship on the part of the moderators to a completely separate
team (as I'm sure is the case with Reddit), then that would tend to go
quite a long way to giving moderators more freedom to censor posts
that are reported as being verbally abusive of others.

## Here's hoping for a little more respect
I'm perfectly open to the idea that I could be wrong on certain issues.
If someone comes to me with a well-thought-out, rational argument,
and I see the validity in what they're saying, I'm perfectly open to
changing my mind on the issue.

What I won't stand for, however, is being verbally abused into having
my mind changed. That is precisely the kind of response that would
**not** change my mind, because there's nothing mature, admirable or
trustworthy about a verbally abusive individual that would cause a
self-respecting individual to change their mind on anything. I also
**refuse to support platforms that facilitate, and don't actively stamp
out that kind of verbal abuse**, which is ultimately why I deleted my
Reddit account. I'll still most likely follow some of the more
interesting subreddits (most likely **not** the South Africa subreddit),
and will monitor the way that people interact with each other. If I feel
that things have gotten better, I may eventually rejoin the
conversation.

Let's please try to encourage a culture of online interaction that
treats others with respect? And even more so if you're anonymous.
