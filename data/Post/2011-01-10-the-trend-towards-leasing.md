I was a little unnerved today when I read about an
[emerging trend](http://trendwatching.com/trends/11trends2011/#ownerless) in
consumer behaviour: business seems to be moving towards an "ownerless" model.
This isn't, of course, true lack of ownership - it just means that consumers
prefer not to own things. We tend to want the latest and greatest, and we want
it now, and we want it without commitment. ADHD?

What I'm wondering is: what happens when all your personal data is stored (read:
owned) by Google or Amazon, your car, house (and the land upon which it stands)
and furniture are owned by the bank, your wardrobe is leased to you on a monthly
basis (catering for the latest fashion trends), and your communication devices
belong to the networks?

The obvious benefit is a "life of sponteneity", which I definitely find
appealing, being a bit of an ADHD kid myself, but what are the drawbacks?
I would be quite uncomfortable with big corporates and governments owning all
of the seriously valuable assets in the world, dictating the terms of those
agreements because of their sheer size or capacity for violence.
